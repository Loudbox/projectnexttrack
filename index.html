							<p>Project Next!Track is a 3D VSRG (virtual scrolling rhythm game) that is primarily inspired by games like Everhood, Stepmania, and Geometry Dash.</p>

							<p>The gameplay mechanics of my project is that you use A and D keys to switch 1 lane to the left/right, there are 5 lanes in total that you can stand on. Switching lanes is a very quick movement, almost instant. The player is always moving forward at a constant pace while a song will play in the background. Lots of notes will appear from the top of the screen and move down towards the player, appearing on-screen in sync with the music. The player has to avoid touching these notes, and can dodge them by either moving out of the way from switching lanes, or by jumping over them. However, some notes are very long and can’t be moved through unless you jump diagonally over the start or end of one, and some notes are very tall and can’t be jumped over. Some notes are wide and can take up multiple lanes. All of these traits can be stacked.</p>

							<p>The project entirely uses C# visual scripting instead of standard scripting, and has pretty well-developed graphics and animations for a prototype.</p>

							<p>The game currently has 3 playable tracks and full character customisation with 3 unique models (not including the default model, which I also custom-made).</p>

							<p>In future updates, I intend to include:</p> 

							<p>Prototype: 5 total songs (one of each difficulty), some songs will have sections full of mirage notes which mirror themselves across the lanes to trick the player, some songs will have anti-air notes which the player will run into if they jump 
								 
							<p>Pre-Alpha Development: 12 total songs (two of each difficulty, plus 2 extra songs), some songs will have moving notes which move across the lanes as the player goes by, some songs will have jumping notes which can be avoided by going underneath or jumping over them (depending on the timing), new ranking graphics, power-ups (which you run into to activate, like an instant heal, or 1-hit protection shield), downgrades (which you don’t want to run into, like making render distance shorter, making notes fade out before they reach the player, locked jump, locked HP regen, 1-hit sudden death mode, etc.), some of these downgrades can be optionally turned on for the entire song for a challenge, songs will initially be locked and they can be unlocked by beating a certain amount of previous songs with a certain minimum rank. 
								 
							<p>Pre-Alpha: 18 total songs (three of each difficulty, 3 extra songs), collectible point system in the middle of songs that will save even after you quit the game, getting a better rank at the end of the song will award more bonus points, shop menu which you can spend your points at to unlock new songs without having to beat other ones or you can spend points to customise your character, practice mode that will let the player skip to any section of a song
								 
							<p>Alpha: 23 total songs (4 extra), enhanced graphics and animations, 6 unique character models
								 
							<p>Beta: 32 total songs (6 extra), final jank polishes 
								</p>
